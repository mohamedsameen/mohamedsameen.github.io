Hi there! I'm Mohamed.
In Europe, I'm Mohamed Ameen.
In the science world, I go by Mohamed S. Ameen.
On my passport: Mohamed Safwat Salaheldeen Ameen.
And in Egypt, simply: Safwat.

Suounds confusing? Trust me, my life is no less messy. 

I am a proud Muslim, Arab, African, Egyptian, but 
I have lived most of my adult life in Europe. 
Am I European? Am I Egyptian? 
"I am everything and nothing."

I am originally a Pharmacist (B.Sc. - Egypt), but 
I studied Neuroscience (M.Sc. - France) too, 
and somehow ended up surrounded by psychologist studying cognition and sleep (PhD - Austria). 
The list goes on and on...

This is my story — shaped by signals, identities, and, most importantly, dreams.
Welcome.
