   Hi there! I'm Mohamed.  
   In Europe, I'm Mohamed Ameen.  
   In the science world, I go by Mohamed S. Ameen.  
   On my passport: Mohamed Safwat Salaheldeen Ameen.  
   And in Egypt, simply: Safwat.  

Sounds confusing? Trust me, my life is no less messy.  

I am a proud Muslim, Arab, African, Egyptian, but  
I have lived most of my adult life in Europe.  
Am I European? Am I Egyptian?  
"I am everything and nothing."  

I am originally a Pharmacist (B.Sc. – Egypt), but  
I studied Neuroscience (M.Sc. – France) too,  
and somehow ended up surrounded by psychologists studying cognition and sleep (PhD – Austria).  
The list goes on and on...  

This is my story — shaped by signals, identities, and, most importantly, dreams.  
**Welcome.**
